Hi!

I'm a third year PhD student in Computer Science at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/computer-science/index.aspx), supervised by [Prof. Iain Styles](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/iain-styles), [Dr. Alexander Krull](https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/en/persons/alexander-krull) and [Prof. Ales Leonardis](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=BEFl4j0AAAAJ&hl=en). My PhD is in collaboration with [GSK](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/careers/experienced-professionals/research-and-development/) with the industrial supervision of [Minh Doan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=M6_hL-AAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Steve Hood](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=mPhF_xkAAAAJ&hl=en) and is set to finish November 2024.

My research interests lie in generative modelling, uncertainty quantification and predictive performance evaluation for conditional image generation problems in bioimaging applications.

Recently, I've worked on designing a pipeline for [evaluating virtual staining for high-throughput screening](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230501) (IEEE ISBI 2023 paper and oral). I received an [Enrichment Award](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) from [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) the UK's national institute for AI. I've been involved with the development of [sci.vision](https://sci.vision/#/) an open-source computer vision package contributing code and pitching sci.vision at [AIUK 2023 PitchFest](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/first-pitchfest-winner-announced-ai-uk-2023). I'm also running an in-person workshop at [The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) on [Uncertainty Quantification for Generative Modelling](https://www.eventsforce.net/turingevents/frontend/reg/thome.csp?pageID=110064&eventID=287&CSPCHD=000001000000E7wPZbwn2oC9Y8iUArSWreuerrl6ME9r7QSoDa) in September 2023. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Data Scientist in what was previously GSK Consumer Healthcare but is now [Haleon](https://www.haleon.com/our-science/our-scientists). During that time I was focused on designing ML-based pipelines for forecasting category growth whilst also studying for the [MSc in Business Analytics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/business-school/masters/business-analytics/) at Imperial College London. I joined GSK back in 2017 on the [Future Leaders Programme](https://www.gsk.com/en-gb/careers/early-talent/future-leaders-graduate-programme/).

I enjoy running, cooking, exploring London with friends and playing my Technic 1210 mk2 turntables with Omnitronic TRM-202MK3 2-Channel Rotary DJ Mixer!

Do reach out to me if my research is of interest to you - I'm always happy to chat about potential collaborations!
